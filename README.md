# NumberWizard
A game where the computer guesses the number you have in mind.

The computer guesses your number by picking a random whole number within the given range.
Each time there is an incorrect guess, the user has to input if the number is higher or lower than the guess, by which they create a new, smaller range.
Eventually a correct answer will be given.
